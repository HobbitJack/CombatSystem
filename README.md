# CombatSystem
### A simple space combat simulation based originally on Stellaris combat.

## CHANGELOG:
  IWV 1:
  This initial working verision lacked critical features and only served as a proof-of-concept.

  V1.0.0:
  This is the first full-featured version of the program supporting stealth and some stability fixes.
